# HW 3 - Map/Reduce with Kubernetes on OctaPi

## Summary
Welcome to the Map/Reduce with Kubernetes on OctaPi. If you're into big data/distributed systems and a Raspberry Pi enthusiast
this is the perfect project for you. If not, there is still a lot you can learn here. Let's start with our objective.

## Objective
Our objective is to create a cluster of 8 Raspberry Pi's that can be used as master/slave system. In essence the
